// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Number

Write "PLease enter two numbers to add"
Read num1
Read num2
Sum= num1+num2
Write Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If X equals a number divisible by 2 the number is Even

If Else X equals a number not divisible by 2 the number is Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5
small = n1
large = n1
for i = 2 to 5:
 if n1 > ni then:
 small = ni
 if n1 < ni: then:
       large = ni
print("Average:", avg)
print("Smallest:", small)
print("Largest:", large)

The pseudocode starts by getting inputs for the 5 values
Next, the average of the 5 values is calculated
The fourth line iterates through the numbers
Within the iteration, there are 2 conditional statements that calculate the smallest and the largest values
The last three lines print the average, the smallest and the largest input
